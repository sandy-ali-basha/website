          What to call your design business is one of the biggest questions
          freelance designers face. As a designer you are running a business,
          whether you have an LLC that clients write checks out to or not. But
          you are also a person who designs, and your reputation is likely tied
          to your first and last name. (Unless youâ€™re so famous people only
          refer to you by one of themz.)
